Overview:

This project is to create a mobile app for the Next-Tech Lab, a student-run organisation dedicated to learning and building. The app will enable users to easily identify and learn about the objects and devices in the lab. The app has been designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, and it will be available to all students and members at the Lab. 

Problem Statement:

Most of you might not know about all the equipment kept here in the lab. Right?
It can be difficult for students and newly recruited members at the Lab to become familiar with all of the objects and devices in the lab. Many of these objects and devices are unfamiliar or complex to use, and it can be challenging for students to figure out how to use them for their projects.

Goal and Objective:

This project is aimed at creating a mobile app that will enable the Next-Tech Lab community to easily identify and learn about the objects and devices in the lab and how to use them to build projects and products. The goal of the app is to enable users to become more knowledgeable about technology and engineering and to empower them to create innovative projects and products.

Solution:

This app helps students in labs understand devices better by scanning objects. Users can learn the devices' purpose and their potential applications for projects. We accomplished this by training lab equipment through Teachable Machine, capturing various angles to enhance accuracy. The result is a streamlined mobile app powered by TensorFlow Lite, offering a user-friendly experience.

Tools and Technologies:

Teachable Machine, Tensorflow, Figma, Canva, Android Studio, Firebase, Kotlin
